# React Router v6 Routes Not Working

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when upgrading from React Router v5 to v6: routes failing to render correctly.

## Problem

After upgrading to React Router v6, routes defined using `Routes` and `Route` components might not render any content. This issue often arises due to inconsistencies in how routes are defined and handled in the new version.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version, ensuring compatibility with React Router v6.

The primary solution typically involves double-checking the path definitions, ensuring they are accurate and properly match the URL structure. Another crucial aspect is verifying that the `Routes` component is correctly wrapped around the `Route` components within a `BrowserRouter`. Missing or incorrectly placed elements can easily lead to routing issues.

## Setup

To reproduce the issue:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the app using `npm start`.

Note that the `bug.js` shows the incorrect implementation and `bugSolution.js` shows the correct implementation.
